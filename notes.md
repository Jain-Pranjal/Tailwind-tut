if we want to make the custom we canm use the square brackets in that we can provide the value in that 
whenever i want to run the script i can do that by using the package json ka run dev 

for making the image border radius rounded use the rounded property  

the space between prpperty will provdie the gap betweent the elements of the div 
the space between will not be applied to the first element of the group 

for adding custom measurement we shoudl use the square bracket notation init 
just put the custom value insdie the square brqacket of the property 

<!-- for the responsiveness we should use the breakpoints in the css  -->

means ke sare breakpoints ke onwards aapki property apply hogi 
sm matlab 640px ke baad property apply hogi in the doc 
md matlab 768 ke baad property apply hogi 

and agar hum esko reverse karvana chaiate hai to use the max in front of the breakpoints 


grouping of mutliple classes into the one class is called the apply directive
by using the appy directive we can merge all the class of one property into one another                                          

how to add the layer directive in css 
<!-- so remember one thing that ke agar humko apni custom classes lani hai to we have to put our apply directive class befiroe the utilites class so that hum tailwind ke class ke upar aaye -->

layers directive mebascially koi bhi class likege to vo usko us layer ke last me dal dete hai at the end 
matlab ke koi bhi class jo bhi layers me likhga vo last of the layer me dal de jayege 

means ke agar hum koi bhi class banate hai inside the layer directive so vo us layer ke last me jake append ho jayege and it will be a apert of that class 
any class that we made inside the layer directive of the layer will make the class at the last append class in it 

<!-- so by using the layer directive hum ek apn custom class ko ya to utility ya fir components me dal skte hai  -->

so use the apply directive only when there is reudable of the classes very much and we can combine those classes into one class name only 

to basially agar extending karna hai config file ko so we can use that also by doing the changes into the config file 
<code>npx tailwindcss init anyname --full</code>

- now we can do the changes in the tailwind config file  by adding any custom properties that are not present in it 


# npm run build 
basically by using this command we can build the productuon package by using the build 
so agar humko ek producion bundle banaana hota hai then we an use the npm rn build jo ke vite ke through aapka ek production bundle bana dega and from that we can deploy static sites on anywhere 

i have to again build the production bundle jab bhi hum npm run build karege to usse ek dist folder banega and then hum apni static website ko kahi par bhi deploy kar skte hai 
so the dist folder actually goes into the production bundle 


<!-- in felx box we can also set the order ke kab konsa element ayega in the ordr of the tailwind flex  -->


for using custom values use the [] in class in which we can add our own custom values
