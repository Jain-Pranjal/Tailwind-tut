if we want to make the custom we canm use the square brackets in that we can provide the value in that 
whenever i want to run the script i can do that by using the package json ka run dev 

for making the image border radius rounded use the rounded property  

the space between prpperty will provdie the gap betweent the elements of the div 
the space between will not be applied to the first element of the group 

for adding custom measurement we shoudl use the square bracket notation init 
just put the custom value insdie the square brqacket of the property 

<!-- for the responsiveness we should use the breakpoints in the css  -->

means ke sare breakpoints ke onwards aapki property apply hogi 
sm matlab 640px ke baad property apply hogi in the doc 
md matlab 768 ke baad property apply hogi 

and agar hum esko reverse karvana chaiate hai to use the max in front of the breakpoints
